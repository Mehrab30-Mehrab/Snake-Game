## 🐍💻 Snake Game in Python

> 🎮 **A classic arcade game brought to life in the terminal!**  
> 🍎 Eat the food, 🐍 grow longer, and 💥 avoid crashing!  
> Built with **Python Turtle** for smooth graphics and real-time movement.  

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

🟩 You control a green snake that moves across the screen.  
🍒 Each time it eats food (a red dot), it grows longer.  
☠️ Collide with the wall or yourself? Game over!  
💯 The game tracks your **score** and **high score** automatically.

### 🚀 Features

✨ Real-time movement using `turtle` module  
📈 Dynamic scoring & high score tracking  
🔁 Endless play until collision  
🎯 Random food placement 

## 🎮 How to Play

- Run `snake_game.py`
- Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move the snake:
  - `W` = Up
  - `A` = Left
  - `S` = Down
  - `D` = Right
- Eat the red food to grow your snake and increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or yourself!

## 🛠️ Requirements
